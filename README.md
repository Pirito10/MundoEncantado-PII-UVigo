  - Now you can run `java MundoEncantado [args]` inside the build directory to run the game.

  - Or you can package everything in to a single .jar file with the following command, also inside the build directory: `jar cfm MundoEncando.jar manifest.txt *`

    - And then run the game with `java -jar MundoEncando.jar [args]`
